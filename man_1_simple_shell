.SH NAME
.B shellby \- Simple UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shellby [\fIfilename\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Shellby\fR is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from a file or standard input and executes them.

.B Invocation
\fBShellby\fR can be invoked interactively or non-interactively. If invoked without a terminal-connected standard input, it executes received commands in order.

When invoked with standard input linked to a terminal, an interactive shell opens. During interactive mode, \fBshellby\fR displays the \fI$ \fR prompt.

Alternatively, providing command line arguments treats the first argument as a file to read commands from. Each line in the file contains one command. \fBShellby\fR executes these commands sequentially before exiting.

.B Environment
Upon invocation, \fBshellby\fR copies the environment of the parent process. The environment contains \fIname-value\fR strings (\fINAME=VALUE\fR) describing variables.

.B Command Execution
After receiving a command, \fBshellby\fR tokenizes it into words using \fB" "\fR as a delimiter. The first word is the command, and the rest are its arguments.

.RS
1. If the command is a shell builtin, it executes the builtin.
2. If the command is an executable file, it searches directories listed in the \fBPATH\fR variable.
3. If the command begins with a slash or dot or any previous search succeeds, \fBshellby\fR executes the named program with its arguments.

.B Exit Status
\fBShellby\fR returns the exit status of the last command executed. Zero denotes success, non-zero indicates failure.

.B Signals
While running interactively, \fBshellby\fR ignores \fBCtrl+c\fR but exits on \fBCtrl+d\fR (end-of-file).

.B Variable Replacement
\fBShellby\fR interprets the following \fI$\fR characters for variable replacement:
$ENV_VARIABLE is substituted with its value.
$? is substituted with the return value of the last program executed.
$$ is substituted with the current process ID.

.B Comments
\fBShellby\fR ignores content after a \fI#\fR character on a line.

.B Operators
Commands separated by \fI;\fR are executed sequentially.
\fIcommand1 && command2\fR: \fIcommand2\fR executes if \fIcommand1\fR returns zero.
\fIcommand1 || command2\fR: \fIcommand2\fR executes if \fIcommand1\fR returns non-zero.

.B Shellby Builtin Commands
